Uranus is a fluid-width 2 column theme based on Binarius, for Moodle 2.4. It is part of a series of ten 'Planet' themes intended to provide a choice of visually accessible and/or fun colour schemes.

Uranus is designed to provide a reduced contrast interface with a light blue backgroud. It also includes a 2.4 compatible version of the MoodleBar developed by Lewis Carr, and uses the autohide functionality for course editing buttons outlined by Frankie Kam.
