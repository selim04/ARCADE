Colours course format for Moodle 2.4
========================================

This course format, based on the 'Topics' standard format, allows a
teacher to specify the foreground and background colours for each
course section.

This is the Moodle 2.4 version, if you are using Moodle 2.3 (or below)
you must download an earlier version of this plugin.

About
=====

This format was created by Davo Smith of Synergy Learning (
http://www.synergy-learning.com/ ), on behalf of Landesmedienzentrum
Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (http://www.lmz-bw.de/ ).

The main files are only lightly modified from those found within the
standard format_topics, the rest is new code.

Installation
============

1. Unzip all the files locally

2. Upload files to the server and place in a folder
'[moodledir]/course/format/colours'

3. Log in to Moodle as an Admin and click on the 'Home' link, to
trigger the installation

Usage
=====

1. On the course settings page, choose the format 'Topics format
(colours)'.

2. Click on the 'Edit colours' icon (on the left of a course section)
to edit the colours for that section.

3. Click on the 'Copy colours' icon (below the 'Edit colours' icon) to
copy the colours from another section into the current section.

Note: only users with the capability 'format/colours:editcolours' (by
default, manager, coursecreator and editingteacher roles) can edit
course colours.

Note: This is compatible with the core Moodle themes, but may not work
as well custom themes.
